# lounge-synapse

Pretty decent theme for The Lounge. Based on the [lounge-neuron](https://github.com/easymac/lounge-neuron) theme by easymac.

**Looking for maintainer**: Unfortunately I don't use Lounge that often these days. If someone's interested in maintaining this theme, submit a couple decent PRs and reach out (or just fork it)! My main TODOs with this theme are:

1. Re-open and merge https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/pull/815 , then hide those duplicate names with [these lines](https://github.com/DanielOaks/lounge-synapse/blob/master/synapse-expanded.css#L357-L359) (makes the extended theme look much nicer).
2. Add Synapse to the new Lounge NPM themes thing, so users can really easily download and install it.

## License

:shrug:, just using the original lounge-neuron license and throwing my name on there since I'm making changes.
